The project successfully demonstrated the design and analysis of a common-base BJT circuit, including thermal management using a custom-designed heat sink. Both free and forced convection were examined, with the heat sink performing within acceptable limits for safe transistor operation. The design followed all the steps applied in the university's laboratory exercises.
